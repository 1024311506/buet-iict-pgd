      <h2>About IICT</h2>
      <p>
        The Institute of Information and Communication Technology (IICT) is one of the institutes of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. The Syndicate of BUET decided on 28th June 2001 to establish the institute, which was formally inaugurated on 2nd September 2001. This decision followed a government initiative to produce more professionals in the IT sector. The former Computer Center of BUET became the backbone of IICT and was upgraded to form the new institute.
      </p>
      <p>
        IICT offers postgraduate programs and continues to provide services previously offered by the Computer Center. It is located on the sixth and seventh floors of the ECE Building at BUET, providing a quiet, accessible, and well-connected location ideal for technology-focused education and research.
